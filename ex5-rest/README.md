This application contains three projects:
A DataLibrary project that contains the data access layer and the SQLite database.
A Web API project that exposes the data access layer as a RESTful API.
A Test project that contains integration tests for the Web API.

The projects were created using the Visual Studio templates for .NET 8.0. The 'prompts.md' contains the many prompts that were used assist in customizing the projects. 

Given the current baseline, the following tasks are required to complete the project:
- Add additional API endpoints to the Web API project to support CRUD operations for the Products, Categories, and Suppliers tables.
- Implement error handling and logging in the Web API project to ensure that any errors are properly logged and handled.
- Add unit tests for the new API endpoints in the Test project to ensure that they are working as expected. 
- Design a client-side app that calls into the 'CoreWebApi' project. The app will use TypeScript and Angular.io.

- Optional: Implement authentication and authorization in the Web API project to secure the endpoints and restrict access to authorized users only.
