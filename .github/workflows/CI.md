Create a workflow file in the '.github/workflows/build_and_test.yml' using GitHub Actions.

Set the workflow name to 'wf-build-and-test'.

The workflow is triggered on three types of events:

1) Push Events: The workflow runs whenever there is a push to the main branch. Additionally, it only triggers if the changes are within the src or tests directories. This ensures that the workflow only runs when relevant files are modified, optimizing the build and test process.

2) Pull Request Events: Similar to push events, the workflow is triggered when a pull request is made to the main branch. Again, it only triggers if the changes are within the src or tests directories. This helps in verifying that the changes in the pull request do not break the build or tests before merging into the main branch.

3) Workflow Dispatch: This allows the workflow to be triggered manually via the GitHub Actions interface. 

Create a job named 'build-and-test' that runs on the latest version of the Windows virtual environment.

Workflow steps:
- **Checkout repository**: Use the `actions/checkout@v4` action to check out the repository.
- **Set up .NET**: Use the `actions/setup-dotnet@v3` action to set up the .NET environment and specify the required .NET version (e.g., 7.x).
- **Restore dependencies**: Run `dotnet restore` to restore the project dependencies.
- **Build the project**: Run `dotnet build --configuration Release --no-restore` to build the project in Release mode.
- **Run tests**: Run `dotnet test --configuration Release --no-build --verbosity normal` to execute the tests and ensure the project passes all test cases.
