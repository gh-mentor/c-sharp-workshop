The application consists of three main components: a Data Library, a Web API, and a testing project. 

- The web API project is configured to use Swagger for generating a UI for the API endpoints, making it easier to test and interact with the API. The integration tests are designed to validate the API's behavior against expected outcomes, ensuring that the application functions correctly.

- The Data Library project is set up to use SQLite as the database provider, and the DbContext is configured to work with the SQLite database. The integration tests use an in-memory database to avoid using the actual database during testing, ensuring that the tests are isolated and do not affect the production data.

- Visual Studio 2022 project templates were used to form the baseline for the three projects, as they provide a structured approach to developing each component. The 'prompts.md' file contains several commands used to help generate the existing code for the Data Library, Web API, and testing project.

Given that the projects are already created, the next step is to extend the functionality for the Web API, and testing project. The Web API will be extended to include additional endpoints for managing the inventory, while the testing project will be enhanced to include more comprehensive tests for the API endpoints. The goal is to ensure that the application is robust and can handle various scenarios without any issues.
Suggested Next Steps:
- Add additional API endpoints to the Web API project to support CUD operations for the Products, Categories, and Suppliers tables.
- Implement error handling and logging in the Web API project to ensure that any errors are properly logged and handled.
- Add unit tests for the new API endpoints in the Test project to ensure that they are working as expected.
- Optional: Implement authentication and authorization in the Web API project to secure the endpoints and restrict access to authorized users only.
