The code is a simple producer-consumer example using `Task` and `TaskCompletionSource`. The goal is to improve the design by following best practices.

- Use Copilot to generate a .gitignore file for a C# project.

- Ask Copilot to explain the existing code and the purpose of using `Task` and `TaskCompletionSource`.

- Use Copilot to separate implementation into appropriate classes and interfaces to follow SOLID principles.

- Use Copilot Chat to review the code and suggest improvements where necessary, with a focus on best practices and design patterns.

- Use Copilot Chat to suggest unit tests for the code using a testing framework such as xUnit, NUnit, or MSTest.

- Build and run the code to ensure it works as expected.
