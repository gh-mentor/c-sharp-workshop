The code is a simple producer-consumer example using `Task` and `TaskCompletionSource`. The goal is to improve the design by following best practices.

- Be sure to understand the existing code and the purpose of using `Task` and `TaskCompletionSource`.

- Separate implementation into appropriate classes and interfaces to follow SOLID principles.
- Use Copilot Chat to review the code and suggest improvements where necessary, with a focus on best practices and design patterns.
- Use Copilot Chat to suggest unit tests for the code using a testing framework like xUnit or NUnit.
- Build and run the code to ensure it works as expected.
