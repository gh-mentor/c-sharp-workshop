The code is a simple producer-consumer example using `Task` and `TaskCompletionSource`. 

The goal is to gain experience using Copilot features effectively.

- Use Copilot to generate a .gitignore file for a C# project.

- Ask Copilot to explain the existing code and the purpose of using `Task` and `TaskCompletionSource`.

- Use Copilot to separate implementation into appropriate classes and interfaces to follow SOLID principles. The classes and interfaces should be in namespace 'ProduceConsumer'.Each type will be in a separate file.

- Use Copilot Chat to explain the code and its structure.

- Use Copilot Chat to suggest unit tests for the code using a testing framework such as xUnit, NUnit, or MSTest.

- Build and run the code to ensure it works as expected.
