General Advice

1.	Iterative Development: Break the steps into smaller tasks and complete them incrementally. For example, complete Steps 1 and 2 before starting Step 3.
2.	Version Control: Use Git to track changes. Commit frequently to avoid losing progress and to make it easier to revert if issues arise.
3.	Leverage Copilot: Use Copilot to generate boilerplate code, but review it carefully to ensure it meets your requirements.
4.	Documentation: Document each step as you complete it. This will help you track progress and debug issues more effectively.

If you feel overwhelmed, consider combining related steps. For example:
�	Combine Steps 1 and 2 by generating the JSON data and testing the model in the same project.
�	Combine Steps 4 and 5 by integrating the model and fetching/displaying data in one go.

If you want, Copilot can generate:
- A list of caveats and recommendations for the project as described in the README.
- Sample Employee model with annotations.
- BaseViewModel + EmployeeListViewModel shell.
- EditorConfig starter.
