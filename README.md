# GitHub Copilot Workshop for C# Developers

## Exercises
- ex1-concurrency: Introduces concurrency fundamentalsâ€”first a simple TaskCompletionSource-based producer/consumer ([ex1-concurrency/ex1a-producer-consumer/README.md](ex1-concurrency/ex1a-producer-consumer/README.md)), then a multi-consumer pipeline using BlockingCollection, result aggregation, and cancellation ([ex1-concurrency/ex1b-concurrent-data-structures/README.md](ex1-concurrency/ex1b-concurrent-data-structures/README.md)).
- ex2-calculate: Refactors naive average salary logic into a decimal-based, validated, test-driven design with clear domain contracts and extensibility prompts ([ex2-calculate/README.md](ex2-calculate/README.md)).
- ex3-template-method-pattern: Demonstrates the Template Method pattern by defining a fixed reporting algorithm with overridable steps for title, headings, rows, and footer ([ex3-template-method-pattern/README..md](ex3-template-method-pattern/README..md)).
- ex4-test-singleton: Progressively hardens a naive singleton logger through phased improvements in testing, thread safety, configurability, DI readiness, error handling, and optional async/log rotation features ([ex4-test-singleton/README.md](ex4-test-singleton/README.md)).
- ex5-transform: Implements a ByteFactory supporting bounded storage, non-mutating XOR and delegate-based byte transformations, thorough NUnit coverage, and guided prompt ladder extensions ([ex5-transform/README.md](ex5-transform/README.md)).
- ex6-assembly-line: Builds an in-memory FactoryAssemblyLine with validated station management, active/inactive tracking, total processing time invariants, and optional cached optimization ([ex6-assembly-line/README.md](ex6-assembly-line/README.md)).
- ex7-rest: Provides an ASP.NET Core Web API (SQLite + EF Core) with inventory domain, Swagger support, and roadmap for testing, pagination, security, and architectural enhancements ([ex7-rest/README.md](ex7-rest/README.md)).
- ex8-gui: Delivers a .NET MAUI MVVM org chart app featuring validation, async data services (mock + HTTP), error resilience, performance considerations, and unit + Appium UI tests ([ex8-gui/README.md](ex8-gui/README.md)).
- simulation: Capstone combining advanced banking and manufacturing simulations emphasizing architecture, concurrency, metrics, detection logic, and extensibility ([simulation/banking/README-bank-scenario.md](simulation/banking/README-bank-scenario.md), [simulation/manufacturing/README-chips-scenario.md](simulation/manufacturing/README-chips-scenario.md)).
