Template Method Pattern Exercise

In this exercise, you will implement and enhance an application that uses the Template Method Pattern. The goal is to understand the pattern, refactor the project to follow best practices, and adhere to SOLID design principles.

Here are some sample prompts you can use with Copilot to guide you through the refactoring and testing phases of this exercise:

1. **Understanding the Pattern**:
   - "What are some best practices for implementing the Template Method Pattern in C#?"

2. **Scaffolding**:
   - "Help me create a basic folder structure for a report generation application using the Template Method Pattern.  The file main.cpp contains the monolithic code that needs to be refactored."

3. **Refactoring**:
   - "Help me refactor the existing application to follow best practices for a Template Method Pattern implementation. The response should adhere to SOLID design principles and be structured in accordance with recommended project structuring."

4. **Testing Phase**:
   - "Outline strategies for effective unit testing of the application components."

5. **Unit Tests**:
   - "Generate unit tests for the classes, ensuring that all public methods are covered."
   - "Is there any need to create mock objects for dependencies to isolate the unit tests?"
   - "Run the tests after implementation to verify functionality and identify any issues."

6. **Documentation**:
   - "Create documentation that explains the Template Method Pattern and how it is applied in this application."
   - "What are the key components of the Template Method Pattern that should be highlighted in the documentation?"
	
7. **Enhancements**:
   - "Is there a pattern that could be applied to improve the maintainability and readability of the code?"
   - "The code as written renders output to the console. How can I modify it to allow for different output formats, such as JSON or XML, while still adhering to the Template Method Pattern?"
